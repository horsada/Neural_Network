## Choosing a Neural Network

3 paradigms of ML:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

Supervised Learning:
- Regression
- Classification:
	
Unsupervised Learning:
- Clustering
- Anomaly detection

Reinforcement Learning:
- Video game playing AI

### Classification

Logistic Regression:
- Input vector with single return value between 0 or 1. 
- Binary classifier

K-nearest Neighbors:
- 2 clusters of data. 
- When a new, unknown, data sample is added, the algorithm determines its type using how many of its neighbors are of which type. 

Support Vector Machine (SVM):
- Constructs a line which divides 2 sets of data to minimise overlapping. 

Decision Trees:
- Go down a tree asking questions to classify data. Algorithm uses probability to make classification possible using the least number of questions. 

### Types of Neural Networks

Hopfield:
- Every neuron in the network sends its output to all other neurons in the network. 

Feedforward:
- Multiple inputs.
- Series of signals propagating forward through layers of neurons
- e.g. Multilayer perceptron

Convolutional:
-  Takes in data, then creates modifications based on previously seen data. Then outputs these modifications to the original data. 

### Multilayer Perceptrons

Consists of 3 layers:
1. Input 
2. Hidden (composed of neurons)
3. Output 

### The Brain
